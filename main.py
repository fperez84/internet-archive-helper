This script is done literally for education purpose and also fun. I knew old
Club Nintendo Chile magazines are available at archive.org, but there are so
many to do click-ops so I thought of automating this using python(Plus, I'm
looking to refine my python skills so this seems like the perfect opportunity).

The script will perform a search on archive.org for 'Club Nintendo' and filter
the results for Chilean issues only. Then it will download them in a given
directory.

For the above, the script is using internetarchive library and to prevent ban
is taking a two seconds delay between downloads.
